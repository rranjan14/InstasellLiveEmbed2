# Stitching up the app

The example app follows MVVM architecture and contains important code which is necessary for the app to function.&#x20;

Copy over the `app` , `di` , `domain` , `repo`,`ui` and `util` folders.

Replace the package \`com.example.instasellliveembed\` with your application's package name.

If you change the structure of the code, make sure you do the necessary adjustments in the imports as well.
